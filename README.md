### Insights and Recommendations

* Shows and Trailers lead in average subscribers due to mass appeal.
* Nonprofits & Activism and Education show strong engagement despite fewer subscribers, highlighting the value of niche content with social or educational focus.
* Entertainment and Music dominate, showing high viewer preference
* The United States, India, and the United Kingdom lead in total subscribers.
* Lower counts in other countries may be due to factors like digital infrastructure, internet access, and policy restrictions.
* Creators should consider focusing on Shows or Trailers to reach larger audiences. However, those in Nonprofits & Activism and Education can still succeed with        high-quality, niche content.
* For YouTubers looking to expand their reach, tapping into countries outside of the US, India, and the UK, with improved digital literacy and infrastructure, could    offer growth opportunities.
* Channels in Entertainment, Music, Tech, and Animals can maximize earnings potential with consistent content and brand partnerships.
* Creators in niche categories like Education should explore diversified revenue models beyond ad revenue, such as sponsorships or memberships.
* Categories with fewer uploads, like Movies, Autos & Vehicles, and Travel & Events, present opportunities for content creators to fill gaps in these markets.
* Creators should produce content that appeals to a global audience by incorporating multilingual content or localizing videos for different regions, especially in     countries with growing digital access outside the top markets like the US, India, and the UK.
* Creators can use insights from their channelâ€™s performance data, like the best-performing video types and viewer demographics, to tailor content strategies for       higher engagement and better audience retention
